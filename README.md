# Steel-Defect-Detection
Casting defects like cracks and voids affect material strength, necessitating accurate inspection. Traditional human inspection is error-prone due to fatigue. This report focuses on using image smoothing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of automated defect detection.
This is a part of code during my research and development internship in IIT Madras in the area of "Artificial Intelligence based Vision Inspection for Manufacturing industries".
